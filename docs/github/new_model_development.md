# ðŸ”€ GitHub Version Control Process

This document outlines the Git workflow and branching strategy used in this repository. It defines how developers should work with branches, create pull requests, and manage updates to both development and production environments.

---

## ðŸŒ³ Branching Strategy

- **`main`** â†’ Production branch  
- **`development`** â†’ Staging/pre-production branch  
- **Feature branches** â†’ Created from `development` for all work

Branch | Purpose              | How to update
-------|----------------------|---------------
`main` | Production releases   | Pull Request from `development`
`development` | Active development and testing | Pull Request from feature branches

---

## ðŸ†• Creating a New Branch

All feature or bugfix branches must be created from `development`.

```bash
git checkout development
git pull origin development

git checkout -b feature/add-new-model
```

Then push your new branch:

```bash
git push -u origin feature/add-new-model
```

---

## ðŸ“¥ Creating a Pull Request

### Feature â†’ Development

Once your feature is complete:

1. Push your branch to GitHub
2. Open a Pull Request **into `development`**
3. Request a review
4. Merge the PR using the GitHub interface

---

### Development â†’ Main

When ready to release to production:

1. Open a Pull Request **from `development` into `main`**
2. Ensure CI passes and reviewers approve
3. Merge the PR using the GitHub interface

---

## ðŸ”’ Branch Protection Rules

Branch protection is configured in GitHub to enforce this workflow:

- Pull requests are required for all updates
- Reviews are required before merging
- CI/CD checks must pass
- Direct pushes are blocked by configuration

---

## âœ… Example Workflow

```text
[feature/add-new-model]
       |
       v
[development]  <-- PR from feature branch
       |
       v
[main]         <-- PR from development (for release)
```
